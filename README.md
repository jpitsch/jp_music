A Spring MVC web application using Hibernate and Spring Security.  

My main goal for this project is to practice setting up a full Spring MVC application and to see what specific ways I would like to implement
certain areas such as the persistance layer and general project layout. It will go through many changes as I experiment with different tech. The initial
project was created with very tight time constraints which was the goal so I can see what my initial response was.  That way I can see what bad habits or design 
choices were made and then correc them for future projects.  The subject matter and features are not the import things for my end goal which is to be able to 
understand what every part of the application requires to function correctly.  I would like to then use this as a spring board (no pun intended :D) for any future 
projects that I have in mind. 

Future Features:
================
These features are in no order of importance unless otherwise stated.

- Unit Testing (Most important!!!)
- Replace Hibernate with Spring Data. (Experimental)
- Convert the XML config files with Annotation based config (Mostly complete minus Spring Security which I am still working on).
- Convert project to Spring 4.0 and Spring Security 3.2 along with moving Maven to the latest (This has been finished).
- Move over to Java 1.8 (Experimental)
