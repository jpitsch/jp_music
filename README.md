========

A Spring MVC application using Hibernate and Spring Security to practice.  This project will go through many changes as I experiment with different tech.

Future Features:
================

1. Replace Hibernate with Spring Data. (Experiment)
2. Convert the XML config files with Annotation based config.
3. Convert project to Spring 4.0 and Spring Security 3.2.
